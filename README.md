# Java Basics Notes

To execute a Java program in InteliJ open the Run Window (shortcut: CTRL + R)

To invoke Java Compiler (manually)

    javac Main.java

But InteliJ does this automatically and stores the Class file somewhere else

.class files are platform independent and can run on any machine that has a Java Runtime Environment (JRT)

To invoke Java Virtual Machine (JVM) manually:

    java com.hellowhirl.Main

- When we run a program from InteliJ all these steps are hidden from us
